    <h1 style="font-family: Arial; font-size:32">My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>I have many hobbies but my number one hobby is reading. I have a really passionate love for reading, I read whenever I can. When I was little I hated reading. I couldn't even hold a book. That's how much I hated it. But then my 6 grade teacher made a read a book called, " The Outsiders", It literally my life changed. After finishing that, I started reading more and more. I'm a very big fan of The Harry Potter Series and the Hunger Games Series. I find it amazing how someone can use reading as an escape from their problems and reality for a while.  My third hobby is listening to music, especially listening to Ariana Grande. My fourth hobby is fangirling over celebrities and tv shows. My final hobby is watching netflix. I love watching netflix. Especially when i'm watching PLL or Arrow. No can disturb me because I will get really mad. I can spend hours watching Netflix. The only bad thing is that I end up either sad or mad because an episode didn't end how I wanted it to or extremely paranoid becuase I feel like A from pretty little liars is going to come into my house anytime and do something.</p>
