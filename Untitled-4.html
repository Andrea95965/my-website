    <p>I have many hobbies but my number one hobby is reading. I have a really passionate love for reading, I read whenever I can. When I was little I hated reading. I couldn't even hold a book. That's how much I hated it. But then my 6 grade teacher made a read a book called, " The Outsiders", I literally my life changed. After finishing that, I started reading more and more. I'm a very big fan of The Harry Potter Series and the Hunger Games Series. I find it amazing how someone can use reading as an escape from their problems and reality for a while. Another one of my hobbies is dancing. I start dancing when I was six years old. I was in a dance group call</p>
