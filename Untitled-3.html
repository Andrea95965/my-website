        <p>My full name is Andrea Karina Ramos Romero. I was born and raised in San Francisco. My mom was born in El Salvador and my dad was born in Mexico.
            I was born on September 28,2002, so I'm currently 14 years old. I have two step sisters and one step brother. I am the youngest out of all of them. I have mostly grown up in the mission district until now that i have moved with my mom to the bayview district. I was raised by my mom and grandma. For elementary and middle school I atteneded Saint Peter's School. I was there for nine years. Now I'm currently a sophmore at Immaculate Conception Academy in the Mission District. Working is a major part of my school. For my first year at ICA, I was assigned to work at BART's main office in Oakland. It was an amazing experience, I met some amazing people that help me become who I am today.
